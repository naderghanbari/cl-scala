## Simple Combinatory Logic in Scala

This is a humble attempt to learn Combinatory Logic by implementing a very simple
DSL for CL-terms and Term reduction in Scala.

The terminology, theorems and lemmas are taken from `Lambda-Calculus and Combinators, an Introduction` by `J. Roger Hindley` 
and `Jonathan P. Seldin`, `Cambridge University Press 2008`, specifically from the second chapter.
