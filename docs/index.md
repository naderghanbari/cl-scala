## Simple Combinatory Logic in Scala

This is a humble attempt to learn Combinatory Logic by implementing a
very simple DSL for CL-terms and Term reduction in Scala.

The terminology, theorems and lemmas are taken from
`Lambda-Calculus and Combinators, an Introduction` by `J. Roger Hindley`
 and `Jonathan P. Seldin`, `Cambridge University Press 2008`,
 specifically from the second chapter.

### First Sample

```scala

import cl._

val (x, y, z) = (Var('x'), Var('y'), Var('z'))
val Kx        = K(x)
val Kxy       = Kx(y)
val K_xy      = K $ x(y)

val shouldBeTrue = x âŠ† Kxy
val l            = Kxy.length

val freeVars     = K_xy.FV
```
